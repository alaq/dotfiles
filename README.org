  - spacemacs inspired keybindings (such as SPC f f to search for a file)

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget -O initial-bootstrap.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alaq/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh && sh initial-bootstrap.sh && rm initial-bootstrap.sh
#+END_SRC

The step above might fail. This is because your $HOME folder might already have some stock configuration files which would be overwritten by Git. The solution is simple: back up the files if you care about them, remove them if you don't care, then re-run `config checkout`.

** Updating

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
config pull && ./bootstrap.sh
#+END_SRC
